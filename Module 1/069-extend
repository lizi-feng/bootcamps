/*Write a function called “extend”.

Given two objects, “extend” adds properties from the 2nd object to the 1st object.

Notes:
* Add any keys that are not in the 1st object.
* If the 1st object already has a given key, ignore it (do not overwrite the property value).
* Do not modify the 2nd object at all.*/
